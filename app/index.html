ACM stands for the <a href="https://www.acm.org/about-acm">Association for Computing Machinery</a>, and it is the world's largest educational computer science organization. ACM is divided up into many student chapters, and this one just happens to be located at, you guessed it, NJIT! If you're a student studying CS, IT, IS, or any other computer-related field, chances are that you'll find joining ACM to be useful. Whether you join for tutoring, use of ACM's vast array of online resources, or just to connect with fellow programmers, ACM is a great organization to be a part of.</p>
