## To-Do List For 2017 Webmaster

- [ ] Add more past eboard members to the eboard table of the database.
- [ ] Add info about/a link to our youtube channel (maybe under the stream tab).
- [ ] Fix the calendar which glitches out in some browsers.
- [ ] Remove dependencies on PHP and replace them with Node.js (Make sure to access the database with prepared statements to avoid SQL injection!).
- [ ] Add more photos of our members and events in general to the homepage.
- [ ] Do something with the near-empty projects page.
- [ ] Add information about our ICPC team to the ICPC page (if we actually compete next year).
- [ ] Anything else that you can think of, be creative!.
