          While ACM is a professional organization, we also pride ourselves on
          providing a fun, safe, and friendly work environment. The ACM office,
          located at GITC 3704, is a place we maintain for people to go do work,
          relax after a hard day of work, or even play games. The office is an
          excellent place to get to know the eboard and other members of the
          club or to just hang out there. We urge all students to take advantage
          of our professional services, and to join our passionate and friendly
          community. We hope to see you around.
